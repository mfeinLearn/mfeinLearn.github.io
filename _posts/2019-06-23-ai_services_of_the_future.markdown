This blog post is going to be about the application that I created to simulate some of the functionality of the SingularityNet blockchain network.

What is SIngularityNet anyway? 

SingularityNet is a decentralized marketplace for Artificial Intelligence currently on the Ethereum Network. It is a network where developers can place their AIs into and earn tokens from having other people use their AIs. The currency running this is called the  AGI token. 

 How does this all work? 

Their is a lot of tools that goes into building a new protocol. To name a few Web3.js, Ganache, and Truffle Framework. 

In a later blog post I’ll go deeper on these topics above so stay tooned!
I just want to say a quick note that with this blog post I’ll be talking about how the network works in a broad sense MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE NETWORK ARE LEFT OUT AND CHANGED TO FOR SIMPLICITY! 

WHY tho?

Because why not?! I love both AI and Blockchain so I decided to create a simulated version of the network with a web application using rails.

What did you create already!

So I created a ruby on rails application that demonstrates how the network works in a basic level of course :P. 
The user is able to login/logout/signup. The user is also able to create Ai and Ai services which will then provide a transaction for the user after the user calls a service with an AI. To do this the user has to have a certain amount of data to the user to sign to confirm. 

The Entity Relationship for this project can be found here:

Last note: This is the MVP of the application I plan on coming back to this and adding a lot more functionality… so stay toon!
